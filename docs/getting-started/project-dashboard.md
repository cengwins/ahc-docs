# Project Dashboard

After you have [created a project](./create-project) there are three sections in the project dashboard. Those are `Overview`, `Configure`, and `Experiments`. There are also two buttons in this page's header to `View repository on GitHub and `Open in Github.dev`.

## Overview

In the `Overview` section, you can see some details of your repository and the readme of your project.

## Configure

In the `Configure` section, you can edit the configuration of your experiments. This page includes `ahc.yaml` and the topology. You can find more details for those in their documentation pages.

- [Editing `ahc.yaml`](./../project-config/ahc-yaml)
- [Topology Management](./../project-config/topology-management)

## Experiments

In the `Experiments` section, you can run the experimentation and see the list of the experimentations you have run previously.

### Experiment Details

After you run an experiment or choose an experiment from the experiments list, you see the experiment details page. On this page, you can see details from the experiment. You can also see the logs.
