# Add Github Token

To import your projects/repositories from Github you need to add your Github token to AHC Experimentation Environment.

You can go to the [profile page](https://ahc.ceng.metu.edu.tr/profile) and set your Github token under the section named `Github Integration`. There is a `GENERATE` button to directly generate a token with the required permissions so you can directly generate the token from there and set it.
