# About AHC Project

AHC Experimentation Environment is developed by a group of students from [METU](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr/) as a senior project. It is an environment in which people can test their projects in a distributed environment. AHC Experimentation Environment eliminates the need for creating a test setup for experimenting with ad-hoc networks.

As the number of bandwidth-hungry applications, and consequently, the demand for communications increases, we have to densify networks by spatial multiplexing to overcome capacity limitations. Designing a scalable and dependable large-scale ad hoc cloud is a significant challenge. Beyond the dependability issues, management of the network is very cumbersome if legacy solutions are employed.  A new design and management paradigm is required: this gap can is addressed with the AHC project, namely an ad hoc cloud computing framework.
 
Ad Hoc computing framework is an experimentation framework that enables students and researchers to develop their simulation environments, run their experiments, and see the results of the experiments. With our scalable and distributed architecture, people worldwide are able to use our system, edit their environment, and help with their projects.
